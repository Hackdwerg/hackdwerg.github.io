Howdy.. 

so once upon a time I was pretty bored and decided to decompile a shitload of android applcations (APK's)
a friend of mine gave me the idea to look them up and I however I was a bit sceptic that I would find anything, I did..

This is a story of a man that found several impactful still stupid flaws in android applications.

I started out, but had no idea what I was getting myself into, I wasnt really familiar with decompiling android applications,
but after a good read this seemd not to difficult. So i found myself in a jungle of Jar's and dexes. 

But I wanted more and I want it faster. I wrote an small script for myself that enabled me to download and decompile the APK's on the fly and automatically searched for the keywords i was looking for..
