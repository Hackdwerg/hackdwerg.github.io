Howdy.. 

I always liked to decompile and untangle applications, not that im a pro at it, but staring at code while rubbing my chin makes me look smart.. sooo.. after a while this became a bit of a rush because the information that developers leave behind is humongous!! So I stumbled upon a pretty interesting app which became a great lesson and a painful reminder of how lazy humans are. So i started (responsibly)hacking and (responsibly)fuzzing around. And this gave me a bit of a challenge...

In a galaxy far far away.... 

I previously wrote an application that eased the process of doing this while automating searching for patterns in the application. So after while I collected tons of information.
