Howdy.. 

I always liked to decompile and untangle applications, not that im a pro at it, but staring at code while rubbing my chin makes me look smart.. sooo.. after a while this became a bit of a rush, because the information that developers leave behind is humongous!! 
So I stumbled upon a pretty interesting app which became a great lesson and a painful reminder of how lazy humans are. So i started (responsibly)hacking and (responsibly)fuzzing around. And this gave me a bit of a challenge...

In a galaxy far far away.... 

I previously wrote an application that eased the process of doing this while automating the searche for particular patterns in the application which could lead to l33t (haha get it?). So after while I collected tons of data.
